# HttpClient

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.4.

### In this project, I have learned the AJAX and HttpClientModule. Know how to get data by API and display them on the template for the client-side, also I know how to crate a form to collect data on the Client-side and send it to the Server-side by API with post method.

#### the UI of this project.
